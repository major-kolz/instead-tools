I am writing new module, that should help with interactivity in game. My aim: define classes of INTEAD's *obj* with specific functionality and simplify the way of it creating. I think, an author wish not spend his time for coding features (*obj* interaction, in this context), that appear in game once or twice. So, I catch some of this patterns of interacting and code it for your. 

**NOTICE:** If you want use *require "class-name"* syntax, you should create symlink in *~/.instead/games* for *classes/class-name.lua*. To link them all use *distribute.sh* (see at root directory of this repository)
