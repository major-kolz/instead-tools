Scripts for preparing directory for new game (by name *newOne*) and packing it for distribution 

- **init.sh** (I suggest create symlink in instead-projects folder, i.e "~/.instead/games") preper new directory for game. Will create new main.lua (with "insteadbegin" word, that unfold in game headline; require *lua.snippets*) and symlinks for *useful.lua* and *assist.sh*
- **assist.sh** - [under construction] will pack game for you (with [repo](http://instead-games.ru/)-correct name and substitut symlinks by real modules)
